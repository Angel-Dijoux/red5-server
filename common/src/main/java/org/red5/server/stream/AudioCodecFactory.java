     * SoundFormat: UB[4] Format of SoundData
     *
     * Standard RTMP bits (for SoundFormat != 9):
     * soundRate = UB[2]
     * soundSize = UB[1]
     * soundType = UB[1]
     *
     * Enhanced RTMP bits:
     * audioPacketType = UB[4] as AudioPacketType
     * if audioPacketType == Multitrack
     *   audioMultitrackType = UB[4] as AvMultitrackType
     *     audioPacketType = UB[4] as AudioPacketType
     *     if audioMultitrackType != AvMultitrackType.ManyTracksManyCodecs
     *       audioFourCc = FOURCC as AudioFourCc
     * else if audioPacketType != Multitrack
     *   audioFourCc = FOURCC as AudioFourCc
     *
     * Format 3, linear PCM, stores raw PCM samples. If the data is 8-bit, the samples are unsigned bytes. If the data
     * is 16-bit, the samples are stored as little endian, signed numbers. If the data is stereo, left and right
     * samples are stored interleaved: left - right - left - right - and so on.
     *
     * Format 0 PCM is the same as format 3 PCM, except that format 0 stores 16-bit PCM samples in the endian order of
     * the platform on which the file was created. For this reason, format 0 is not recommended for use.
     *
     * Nellymoser 8-kHz and 16-kHz are special cases 8 and 16 sampling rates are not supported in other formats, and
     * the SoundRate bits canâ€™t represent this value. When Nellymoser 8-kHz or Nellymoser 16-kHz is specified in
     * SoundFormat, the SoundRate and SoundType fields are ignored. For other Nellymoser sampling rates, specify the
     * normal Nellymoser SoundFormat and use the SoundRate and SoundType fields as usual.
     *
     * If the SoundFormat indicates AAC, the SoundType should be set to 1 (stereo) and the SoundRate should be set to 3
     * (44 kHz). However, this does not mean that AAC audio in FLV is always stereo, 44 kHz data. Instead, the Flash
     * Player ignores these values and extracts the channel and sample rate data is encoded in the AAC bitstream.
